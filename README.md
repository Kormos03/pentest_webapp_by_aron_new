This project (pentest school) is a full stack web project. I'm creating this to learn and to teach others for any kind of web vulnerabilities and to practice full stack web development.The frontend is ready to use in local.
To start first clone this project. Next, you have to install the dependencies with, "npm install", in the frontend directory. Then you can start the app with the "npm run dev", after that we can reach the site in the localhost:5173
