        <h1>Welcome to Pentester School!</h1>
        <p>Learn about Web Vulnerabilities in a Nutshell</p>

        <h2>What You'll Learn</h2>
        <p>In this school, you will explore the most common web vulnerabilities that attackers exploit. Our goal is to equip you with the knowledge to recognize and prevent these vulnerabilities in your own applications.</p>

        <h3>Core Topics</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):</strong> Understand how attackers can inject malicious scripts into web pages and how to defend against it.</li>
            <li><strong>SQL Injection:</strong> Learn how SQL queries can be manipulated to gain unauthorized access to your database.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):</strong> Discover how attackers can trick users into executing unwanted actions on their behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Clickjacking:</strong> See how malicious actors can trick users into clicking on something different than what they perceive.</li>
            <li><strong>Insecure Deserialization:</strong> Explore how attackers exploit deserialization processes to execute arbitrary code.</li>
            <li><strong>File Upload Vulnerabilities:</strong> Learn about the risks associated with allowing users to upload files and how to secure them.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why It Matters</h3>
        <p>Web security is crucial for protecting both users and applications. By understanding these vulnerabilities, you can develop safer, more secure web applications, and protect your users from potential attacks.</p>
